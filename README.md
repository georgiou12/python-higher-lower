# python-higher-lower
python "higher or lower" game.
Just the typical online "game" of higher or lower. It is based on instagram followers for comparisons.
All the data are on data.py file, an already made file by Angela Yu and it was written on the online browser based IDE 
called Replit.
Every choice is made randomly and if the guess of the pleyer is correct then on the next round the first instagram account, 
is the account with the most followers of the previous round. When the player loses the score is printed.
